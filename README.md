# Mars_Challenge
Module 11 Challenge

## Overview
I created a Beautiful Soup object and used it to extract text elements from the Mars News website. I then extracted the titles and preview text of the news articles from the website and stored each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary.

## Analysis
* By querying the data, I found that there are 12 months on the planet Mars.
* There are 1867 Martian (and not Earth) days' worth of data that exist in the scraped dataset.
* The coldest month on Mars appears to be the 3rd month of the year, whereas the hottest is the 8th month of the year.

* The average minimum daily temperature for all of the months:

* Month 6 has the lowest atmospheric pressure on Mars, whereas month 9 has the highest.
